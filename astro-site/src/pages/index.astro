        <h2>Why Two Worlds?</h2>
        <p>
          The multiverse isn't a gimmick. It is the core of the story. Each jump tests the cast
          in new ways and reshapes the rules as the stakes climb.

      <article class="card" data-reveal>
        <h3>Shift with the story</h3>
        <p>
          On Earth, investigations build dread. Beyond the portal, magic and myth demand bold
          choices. The cast must learn, adapt, and survive what the Keeper has planned.
        </p>
